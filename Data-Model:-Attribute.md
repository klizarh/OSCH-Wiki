# Attribute
An attribute is is the quality of a substance (from Barry White)

## Objective Attributes
Objective attributes are things that are not subject to individual subjective interpretation, they could be automated without human intervention.  These are measurements like dimension (height, width, length) or mass/weight.  You can take a ruler or scales and everyone following the same protocol should get the same result within parameters.

## Subjective Attributes
Subjective attributes are determined in a person's head: "Do I like the flavor?", "Does it have good color?"
Subjectivity should be avoided whenever possible, but it cannot be avoided and can be helpful at times.  A good example of subjective attributes is [wine tasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_tasting), there are even [ISO standards for the drinking glass](https://www.iso.org/standard/9002.html).  Possible attributes could be:
* Taste
* Sweetness
* Bitterness

## Subjective Measurement Scales
  I would recommend that several subjective value scales be agreed upon using a 1 to 10 scale.  These scales could include:
* Like - Dislike
* Agree - Disagree
