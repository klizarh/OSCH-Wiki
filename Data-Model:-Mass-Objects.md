When we think of an 'object' we usually think of a ball, cat, dog or something that has clear boundaries.  The cat is sitting on a mat; we know where the cat ends and the mat begins.
Mass objects lack clear boundaries: air and water, a bag of seeds.  The water that is in a glass seems to have clear boundaries, but if I drink part of it, is it still the same water in the glass?
With the MVP, there are distinct objects like a plant, si7021 sensor, reservoir; but also mass objects like the water/nutrient in the reservoir or the air in the chamber.  Under different circumstances we may be referring to all the air in the chamber (CO2 percentage), or we may need to differentiate _parts_: the air:canopy air temperature may be different from top of the chamber air temperature, though there is no clear boundary between these two places.
