# Software Standards.

The main goal is that code is readable and understandable to everyone, especially new users.

In short: run [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) against your code and get a 10 rating.  For a quick overview, look at the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for common sense suggestions.

For the full Python standard, follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide used by the Python Foundation.

There is no guarantee that all code meets this standard, since some code is borrowed from other sources and legacy code is not rigidly cleaned up.  As they say, these are more guidelines than rules.
