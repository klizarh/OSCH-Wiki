# Software Standards
Since most code is Python, we will be following the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide used by the Python Foundation.  The main goal is that code is readable and understandable to everyone, especially new users.

There is no guarantee that all code meets this standard, since some code is borrowed from other sources and legacy code is not rigidly cleaned up.  As they say, these are more guidelines than rules.

The [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) is another source of common sense suggestions.
